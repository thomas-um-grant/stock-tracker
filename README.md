# <Stock Tracker>

## Description

I started this project as part of an interview, might actually continue on once graded!
This is a stock tracker, it tracks stocks using the Polygon API, I selected 3 stocks for version 1 (APPL, MSFT, TSLA).

I learned Vuejs(html / css / javascript) to develop my front end and Flask with python to develop my backend.
I also used Heroku to deploy it on a docker image.

- Dynamically adding stocks
- Enabling period picker
- Working on the site robustness
- Building a real SQL DB to reduce API calls

Thank you to a bunch of youtubers for getting me up to speed with front end tools,
especially @ChartJS-tutorials and @NetNinja, I might have underestimated the challenges frontend devs experience haha!
